<p>Discover how to design, construct, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase staff member safety and reduce criminal offense. The most recent Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is pricey, but it pumps images up to 4K resolution and has a great daytime image. In our testing, however, we discovered the motion sensor to be sensitive, with dreadful night-vision performance, and wonky tracking and bad battery life to boot.
