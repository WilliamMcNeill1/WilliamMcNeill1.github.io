<p>This cool smart alarm has a motion detector and siren in one device. Throughout testing, we found it was simple to arm and deactivate and the motion detection was precise, with the siren rapidly setting off when motion was identified. We love that it likewise lets you know when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For the majority of homes, you'll need several Minuts throughout your residential or commercial property, which can get costly. It's also worth noting that it has to be installed on the ceiling (it just keeps track of for motion in the 25m squared below), which is fiddly.

With that said, we would not advise this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home features. But if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we think you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
