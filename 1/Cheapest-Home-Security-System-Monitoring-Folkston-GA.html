<p>ALARM USER. Any person, company, association or corporation of any kind in control of any building, structure or center in which an alarm is set up, operated and maintained. In the case of an occupancy, the tenant will be considered the sole alarm user at the alarm site.

<h3>Home Alarm Security System Folkston GA 31537</h3>
<p>When your video cameras are set up, you can choose whether or not your cameras will be monitored by the central station. If you pick to have your cameras monitored (this is usually provided for cameras that are monitoring outdoor areas), then yes, main station operators will see the video that is taped when an alarm is triggered. However, you may choose to NOT have your cameras monitored by the Central Station (this is generally provided for cameras that are monitoring indoor, residential areas). Cameras that are not monitored by the main station can not be accessed our operators for any reason, even if requested by the client.</p>
