We have discovered some improvements given that the camera's launch, and will continue to check and upgrade this review, as required.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not terrific-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching.
