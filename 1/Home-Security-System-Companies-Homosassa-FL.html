These security cameras connect to a user's home wifi network and enables that user to see the video from anywhere. A typical misunderstanding is that wireless implies the camera is wire-free. This is not the case as wireless cameras may still require a power cable. Wired security cameras are linked to a recorder directly which then links to the internet and a router. Lastly, wire-free cameras are completely cable television free and battery powered. Although battery replacements are required, these are the easiest choice to install and all of the recorded video is stored in the cloud.</p>
