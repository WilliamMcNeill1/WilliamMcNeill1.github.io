Eventually, he cautions, "people may find out to be careful about the books and periodicals they read in public, avoiding titles that may alarm unseen observers. They might also put more believed into how they dress, lest they appear like terrorists, gang members, drug addicts or hookers." Undoubtedly, the studies of cameras in Britain discovered that individuals considered to be "out of time and location" with the surroundings went through prolonged surveillance.</p>
