<p>The growing presence of public cameras will bring profound but subtle changes to the character of our public spaces. When residents are being viewed by the authorities - or aware they might be enjoyed at any time - they are more uncomfortable and less free-wheeling. As syndicated writer Jacob Sullum has explained, "understanding that you are being enjoyed by armed federal government agents tends to put a damper on things. You do not want to anger them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Eventually, he cautions, "people may find out to be careful about the books and periodicals they read in public, avoiding titles that may alarm unseen observers. They might also put more believed into how they dress, lest they appear like terrorists, gang members, drug addicts or hookers." Undoubtedly, the studies of cameras in Britain discovered that individuals considered to be "out of time and location" with the surroundings went through prolonged surveillance.</p>
