<p>Establishing a secure and safe environment for a commercial or residential property is the obligation of the entire community. Storage capacity: For video recorders, the first question you need to ask yourself is just how much storage you will require. The response hinges on a number of aspects: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived footage you mean to store and how long you prepare to keep recorded video. The video footage is going to eat up storage space rapidly if there are many cameras shooting in a greater resolution.

This also depends on the provider, but you can expect signing an agreement with providers who need expert installation of their systems. The average length of a home security agreement is 36 months or 3 years. On the higher end, some agreements might span as much as 60 months or 5 years.
