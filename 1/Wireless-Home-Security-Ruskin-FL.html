<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important feature. Also great metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Must be a much better method to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
