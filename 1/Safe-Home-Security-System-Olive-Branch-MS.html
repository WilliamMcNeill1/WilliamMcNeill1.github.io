Search for a model that offers a high resolution (1080p), a wide angle lens (140 to 180 degrees), a night vision range approximately 25 feet, and budget friendly cloud storage for tape-recorded video. In some cases it's practical to be able to see what happened just before or after a visitor approaches your door.
