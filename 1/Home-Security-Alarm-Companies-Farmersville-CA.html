The one significant benefit of 4K resolution is the ability to deal with information after the reality, which suggests that users can zoom in on details such as faces while the recording of a security event plays. However, while 4K resolution offers some benefits, it also brings with it some downsides. 4K images are huge and use up a lot of tape-recording storage space.
