<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We've discovered that battery life never matches the manufacturer's statistics given that this originates from tests in a controlled environment without continuous video recording, which is the biggest perpetrator for brief battery life by far. We concur with you about Blink's exceptional battery life over on our outdoor security camera evaluation, but its recording capacity is a bit restricted to recommend as a top choice.</p>
<p>While you're doing your shopping, bear in mind that you can build up a wise security system piece by piece: fitting a network of wireless cameras is no longer the expensive one-and-done overhaul that it used to be. Today's systems can be customized and expanded as essential. There are numerous alternatives for night vision cameras at your disposal. Most of them are affordable yet highly practical. If you're looking for night vision cameras that supply the brightest and best night view, go for models that leverage infrared (IR) technology. Some models are developed to activate the IR innovation immediately depending upon the light conditions. Furthermore, make sure the camera has 100 feet of night vision or more.</p>
<p>Opt for IP camera if you require high speed recording. In my view it is the very best security system with low cost of ownership. CCTV systems are complex.
