I Would absolutely buy from cctvsecuritypros again. I highly suggest this company.

Assume 2 cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of vision and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This means the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread out that image throughout a far bigger space and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>
<p>The Nest Webcam IQ Outdoor streams 1080p video with the same membership design and same app as the initial Nest Web cam Outdoor, but it includes more-detailed individual detection, a brighter image, an automated close-up tracking function (which follows a person around the viewing location), much better audio, a more powerful mount, and a broader operating temperature level variety (-40 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit).
