<p>What is a thermal camera, and where might you desire one? Here is a brief explanation of how thermal cameras work: All items release infrared energy (heat) as a function of their temperature level.

A thermal camera includes a heat sensor that is capable of identifying small distinctions in temperature. The gadget collects the infrared radiation from items in the scene and creates an electronic image based upon information about the temperature level differences.
