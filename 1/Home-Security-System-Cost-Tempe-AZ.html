<p>This being Ring, the app is polished and professional too, and if you wish to see what your camera is recording then you can get the video up on an Echo Program or a Fire TV gadget with a simple Alexa voice command.

<p>Three big benefits of wireless security systems for tenants are their impermanence, mobility and expandability. Occupants, unlike homeowners, generally avoid making long-term changes to their homes. Hardwired security systems therefore aren't useful; they include drilling into walls and installing long-term electrical circuits.
