Some zones may set off a call to the local heating oil company to go check on the system, or a call to the owner with information of which space might be getting flooded. Some alarm systems are connected to video surveillance systems so that present video of the intrusion area can be quickly displayed on a remote monitor, not to point out recorded.</p>
