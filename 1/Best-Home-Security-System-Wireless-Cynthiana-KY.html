Storage capacity: For video recorders, the first question you have to ask yourself is how much storage you will require. The response depends upon a couple of aspects: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived video you mean to store and how long you plan to keep taped footage. If there are lots of cameras shooting in a greater resolution, the video footage is going to eat up storage space quickly. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the earliest footage as soon as you reach the system's capability, but if you're not careful, the system might overwrite archived footage that you still require.</p>
