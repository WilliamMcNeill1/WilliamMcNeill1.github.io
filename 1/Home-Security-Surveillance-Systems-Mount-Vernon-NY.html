Nevertheless, keep in mind that the monitoring company's reaction time has definitely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will respond to the alarm-- if they respond at all. In Los Angeles, for instance, all alarm calls must be validated, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone.
