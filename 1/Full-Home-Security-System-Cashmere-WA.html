We enjoy that the system consists of a wifi security camera and only informs you when motion is produced by something with the very same heat pattern as a human (making sure there's no incorrect informs). Nevertheless, you do need to sign up for the external monitoring service (from ₤ 12.99 each month) to be able to see recording from the wifi security camera and get alerts on your phone if the sensors have been activated.
