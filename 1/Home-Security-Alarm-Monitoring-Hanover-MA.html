But today you'll find more home security options than ever before that deal much shorter agreements and month-to-month (contract-free) terms-- especially if you can spend for equipment up front. If you cancel early-- and some require 100%, the majority of home security companies will charge you around 75% of the staying term of your agreement.</p>
