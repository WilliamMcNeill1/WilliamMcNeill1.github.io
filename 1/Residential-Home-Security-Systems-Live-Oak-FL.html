However, remember that the monitoring company's reaction time has absolutely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will react to the alarm-- if they respond at all. In Los Angeles, for example, all alarm calls should be verified, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City needs confirmation from a personal security guard. A number of cities likewise require a permit to even run a home and own security system. Guidelines such as these are created to restrict the time and resources that police and fire departments waste on false alarms. Lots of towns will fine you for too many false alarms.</p>

An alarm gotten in this way can not be canceled. A couple of years earlier, there were just a handful of security companies in the video game. Now, there are dozens.
