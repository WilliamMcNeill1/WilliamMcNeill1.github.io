However, to conserve that battery power, recordings max out at simply 10 seconds, with the system leaving a space of between 12 seconds and 35 seconds from one clip to the next. Likewise, the Blink doesn't give you geofencing or two-way communication, and its 720p image was a bit fuzzy in darker locations.
