The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really important function. Likewise nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Must be a much better method to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly suggest.</p>
