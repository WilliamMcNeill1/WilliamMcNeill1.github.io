IP cameras can likewise be connected to what is known as a "power over Ethernet" (PoE) switch, which both sends information from the camera and supplies power to it. Analog cameras, on the other hand, require a switch to run the signal from the camera in addition to a different source of power, implying a more complicated setup and more wires. PoE switches are also generally regarded as a more secure method to transmit data.</p>
<p>The NVR eliminates these problems, since it is rather linked directly to a network. IP cameras that are connected to the exact same network, generally by method of a PoE switch, are then able to transmit video to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, simply due to the fact that they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transfer video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance constraints so long as a camera is linked to the exact same network as the NVR. The largest disadvantage to an NVR system, nevertheless, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR.
