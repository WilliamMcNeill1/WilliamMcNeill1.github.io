<p>Since it's more complex than it should be, we don't advise the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, notifies, and integration all need different IFTTT-style guidelines. Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are kept for as much as 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly fee (or $80 annually) to store 30-second clips for thirty days.

<p>No matter what kind of alarm you have, a lot of alarm systems work the exact same method. They use open and closed circuits to move an electrical present. When this electrical current is not being moved it sets off an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut. Which implies if the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits. If somebody were to unlock that would indicate that the electrical current can no longer be moved, which would then trigger the burglar alarm. Nevertheless, in an open circuit security system, opening the door permits the electrical present to flow throughout the system, which means when the doors are shut the alarm system will activate.</p>
