<p>What is a thermal camera, and where might you want one? Here is a quick explanation of how thermal cameras work: All things discharge infrared energy (heat) as a function of their temperature level.

A thermal camera includes a heat sensor that is capable of discovering tiny differences in temperature. The device collects the infrared radiation from items in the scene and creates an electronic image based upon details about the temperature distinctions.

In the worst case, all that would be required is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can send video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance constraints so long as a camera is connected to the same network as the NVR. The largest drawback to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR.
