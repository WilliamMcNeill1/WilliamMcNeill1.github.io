Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Should be a much better method to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
