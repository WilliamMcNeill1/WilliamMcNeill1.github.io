Its Wi-Fi connection and battery make it simple to install practically anywhere a ladder can reach. Doorbell cameras have become a popular security tool.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly impressive by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry.

However if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
