<p>Everyone we dealt with at NSS were really handy and accommodating. The services they provided were exactly what we wanted, and they carried out with professionalism and proficiency. I'm not sure if any consumer-grade outdoor camera carries out all that well when it's foggy or raining, especially in the evening when weather conditions really mess with the night vision.

And while expert installation is not required, there are companies that offer wireless security with full installation if it's not something you want to handle yourself.</p>

<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, typically referred to as shock sensors, are various in that they are set up on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces specific shock frequencies which travel through the glass and typically through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling. Normally, the most intense frequencies created are between 3 and 5 kHz, depending upon the kind of glass and the existence of a plastic interlayer. Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn produce an alarm condition.</p>
