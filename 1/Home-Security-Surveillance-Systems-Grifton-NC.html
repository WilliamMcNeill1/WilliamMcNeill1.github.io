<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational information to a harmful assailant, since the interruption of the network prevents the flow of information and in fact indirectly protects data by preventing it from being sent. The usual reason for carrying out a DoS attack is to observe the recovery of the wireless network, during which all of the initial handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, supplying an opportunity for the malicious enemy to tape these codes and utilize different splitting tools to evaluate security weak points and exploit them to get unauthorized access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a variety of tools readily available which can launch a dictionary design attack of "potentially accepted" security keys based on the "model" security key captured throughout the network recovery.</p>
