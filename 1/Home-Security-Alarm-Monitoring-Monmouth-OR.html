<p>Frame rate: This is another essential aspect of a camera-- the higher the frame rate, the smoother the video. Video is merely a series of still images sewn together to develop a movie. The lower the frame rate, the less often a still is taken; this results in choppier footage. You'll wish to think about the frame rate of the camera you buy before deciding.
