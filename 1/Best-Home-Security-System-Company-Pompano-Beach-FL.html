In Los Angeles, for instance, all alarm calls must be verified, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone.

Historically the expenses of these reactions have been paid by the City's general fund. Seattle estimates the costs will recover more than $1.8 million in City costs that were formerly absorbed by general taxpayers.</p>
