<p>A good idea is to check it with your mobile phone if you are not sure about whether the wireless CCTV camera type will work in a particular place.

There are no proximity limitations so long as a camera is connected to the very same network as the NVR. The largest downside to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR. So you'll need to understand whether your cameras will work with a provided video recorder before purchasing.</p>
