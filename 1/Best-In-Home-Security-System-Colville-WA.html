<p>Some wireless security companies have extra features and prepare for an added cost. You'll have to pay a yearly or monthly cost if you 'd like to have continuous video recording and cloud storage for your security cameras. Much of these deals don't include a contract, but some might need an agreement for the equipment or professional monitoring services.
