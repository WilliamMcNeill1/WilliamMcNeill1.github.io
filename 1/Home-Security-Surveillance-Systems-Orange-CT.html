<p>CR's take: The Wyze Web Cam V2 is a fantastic security camera and an incredible value. It gets an Outstanding score for video quality and is much easier to utilize than the other cameras on this list. It also succeeds in our personal privacy and security tests. The camera features a rolling 14 days of complimentary storage for motion-trigged video, person detection, voice control through Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the ability to save video in your area on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not provide paid membership prepare for extra cloud storage. But the company does provide a Complete Motion Capture service that constantly records for as long as motion is found. Without an sd or the service card for local storage, the camera stops recording after 12 seconds.</p>
<p>The least pricey, $240 for Outdoor Base, provides you an Echo Dot plus indoor and outdoor lighting designed to make it appear like you're home."

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly remarkable by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we wouldn't advise this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. However if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
