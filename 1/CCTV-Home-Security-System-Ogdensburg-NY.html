<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, usually referred to as shock sensing units, are various because they are installed on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces specific shock frequencies which take a trip through the glass and often through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling. Generally, the most intense frequencies generated are between 3 and 5 kHz, depending upon the kind of glass and the existence of a plastic interlayer. Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn produce an alarm condition.</p>
