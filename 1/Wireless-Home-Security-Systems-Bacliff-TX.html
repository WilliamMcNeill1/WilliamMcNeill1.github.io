<p>The Nest Web cam Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were outstanding in our testing-- during the day and in the evening-- with a broad, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that permitted us to get a closer view in live video.

<p>We've long been fans of the Netatmo Invite camera (₤ 199), with its downplayed appearances and face recognition software application. The latter enables you to see exactly when a particular person comes to the house - so you'll when the kids got home from school and if they were alone, and whether the cleaner showed up on time.

They also plan to introduce a wise smoke alarm and siren later this year, that makes this an even better proposal.</p>
