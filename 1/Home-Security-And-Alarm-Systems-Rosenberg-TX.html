If there are many cameras shooting in a greater resolution, the video footage is going to consume storage space rapidly. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the oldest video once you reach the system's capacity, however if you're not mindful, the system might overwrite archived video footage that you still need.</p>

If you wish to find out about Scout Alarm's distinct history in the market, and discover more information about the system, checked out the complete evaluation.
