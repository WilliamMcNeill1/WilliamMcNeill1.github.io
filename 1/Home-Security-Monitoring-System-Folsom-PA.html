Look for a model that uses a high resolution (1080p), a large angle lens (140 to 180 degrees), a night vision range as much as 25 feet, and inexpensive cloud storage for tape-recorded video.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and then integrates the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely typical because the doorway and room seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of catching video of everybody going into the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as customers realize that the inexpensive consumer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's normally too late considering that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
