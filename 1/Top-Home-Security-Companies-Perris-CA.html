<p>Another method to store recordings on a non-analogue media is through making use of a digital video recorder (DVR). Such a gadget is comparable in performance to a PC with a capture card and appropriate video recording software Unlike PCs, many DVRs developed for CCTV functions are embedded gadgets that require less upkeep and easier setup than a PC-based service, for a medium to a large number of analogue cameras.

By combining LiveWatch Do It Yourself security systems with Moni's professional monitoring, we can see Brinks Home Security competing with other big names in the market. During our hands-on testing of Brinks, we found the systems to be rather simple to establish and utilize-- however not rather as easy as brand names like SimpliSafe or Ring Alarm.</p>

Both also do not have person detection and geofencing, which other cameras use to cut down on false informs.</p>
