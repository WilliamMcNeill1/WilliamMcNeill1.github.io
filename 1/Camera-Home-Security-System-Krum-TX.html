<p>To gauge response times for the monitoring company, we activated each system a minimum of five times, utilizing contact and motion sensing units. Nevertheless, keep in mind that the monitoring company's response time has absolutely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will react to the alarm-- if they respond at all. In Los Angeles, for example, all alarm calls should be validated, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City requires confirmation from a private guard. Several cities also require a permit to even run a home and own security system. Rules such as these are developed to limit the time and resources that police and fire departments waste on false alarms. Lots of towns will fine you for too many incorrect alarms.</p>

Most home security companies will charge you around 75% of the remaining term of your agreement if you cancel early-- and some require 100%.</p>
