As syndicated writer Jacob Sullum has pointed out, "knowing that you are being seen by armed government representatives tends to put a damper on things. You do not wish to upset them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Ultimately, he alerts, "people may find out to be mindful about the books and regulars they check out in public, avoiding titles that might alarm hidden observers.
