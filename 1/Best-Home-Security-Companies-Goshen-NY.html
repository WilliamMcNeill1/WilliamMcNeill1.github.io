<p>As a Contributing Editor for PCMag, John Delaney has actually been checking and evaluating displays, TVs, PCs, networking and clever home gear, and other assorted hardware and peripherals for almost twenty years. A 13-year veteran of PC Publication's Labs (most recently as Director of Operations), John was accountable for the recruitment, training and management of the Labs technical personnel, along with assessing and keeping the stability of the Labs screening makers and treatments. Prior to signing up with Ziff Davis, John invested 6 years in retail operations for Federated Stores, Inc.  prior to accepting a buying position with Morris Choice Systems, one of New york city's first value-added resellers of the initial IBM PC.

<p>As an incentive to buy an alarm, a number of companies use "totally free monitoring services" for the very first few months. Lots of insurance companies use discount rates on insurance coverage premiums to customers with operable alarm systems. These discounts might be as much as 20 percent for commercial clients, and slightly less for residential owners. 16 In addition, numerous cops departments use a number of "free" false alarms prior to enforcing any fine, even though the cost to react is substantial right from the start. The offers of complimentary monitoring services by alarm companies and discount rates from insurance providers call into question the appropriateness of the present trend in U.S. policing of enabling three or four complimentary false alarms per calendar year, because they offer no up-front incentives to encourage owners to prevent false alarms.</p>
