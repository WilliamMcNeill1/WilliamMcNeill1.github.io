The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial feature. Also great metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Should be a better method to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness at night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>
