<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important feature. Likewise nice metal building and construction.
