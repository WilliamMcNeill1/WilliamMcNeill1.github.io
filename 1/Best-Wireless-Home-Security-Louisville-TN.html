After we utilized the Anker EufyCam for almost six months, we're stunned to report that it is on track to provide on its promise of up to one year of battery life.

<p>In August 2019, the LockPickingLawyer YouTube channel published a video demonstrating how to hack into a SimpliSafe system utilizing a $2 remote. When it identified any type of disturbance, SimpliSafe reacted with a statement saying the system would signal users.

Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests using 2 different 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensing units situated 6 to 26 feet away from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were not able to reproduce the concern. Although our testing shouldn't be taken as definitive, our company believe this issue is not likely to be a real-world issue for SimpliSafe consumers who own the existing system.</p>

<p>Unlike many other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Instead, you can filter occasion notices only by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is offered only with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more notifies, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When utilized in high-traffic locations, the subscription is more useful. Otherwise, the Smart Place feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent notifies each time you walk by.
