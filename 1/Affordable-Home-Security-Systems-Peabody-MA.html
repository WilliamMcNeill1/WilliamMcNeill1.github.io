<p>Home security should never ever be restricted by where you can position or power your cameras, inside or outdoors. The Ring Base Station lets you connect Ring Alarm elements so that you can monitor them through the Ring App. The Ring Base Station also incorporates with Alexa-enabled gadgets.

In the worst case, all that would be needed is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transmit footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance constraints so long as a camera is connected to the very same network as the NVR.
