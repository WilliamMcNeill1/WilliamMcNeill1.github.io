<p>Sensors enable cameras to start and stop recording based upon time or motion detection. The one time where lag does end up being a bit of a problem is between detecting and recording motion.

They could get past the camera before it had time to record them if a dubious bad guy was quick enough. Cell phone can also now be used to remotely set and unset alarms through apps.</p>

<p>Unlike many other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Instead, you can filter event notifications only by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is available just with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more alerts, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The subscription is better when utilized in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Area feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent informs every time you walk by. Oddly, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everybody in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>
