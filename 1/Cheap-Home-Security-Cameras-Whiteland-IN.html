<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not fantastic-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor.

Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have dreadful night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion triggers.</p>
