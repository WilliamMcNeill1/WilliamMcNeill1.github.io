<p>The most significant reason people choose to monitor their own system is to save cash.

The DVR converts the analog signal to digital, compresses it, and then stores it on a disk drive for later retrieval. Monitors can be linked to the DVR for viewing, or the system can be set up to communicate via network or mobile app for seeing.</p>

<p>Depending on the brand name and design alarm control board you own there might be a back door" into your panel's Program Mode if the Installer Code is not understood. Honeywell panels for instance have an easy method to enter Program Mode if the code was forgotten or not provided.
