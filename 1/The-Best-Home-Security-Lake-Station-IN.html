Not just is the Arlo quick to choose moving products, it's brainy enough to make a good stab at working out exactly what it's taking a look at. Just a couple years ago, the home security market was controlled by a couple of big names providing costly, rigid strategies with little flexibility and hostile, long-term agreements.

<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky.

<p>I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Likewise nice metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Must be a better way to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness in the evening. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly recommend.</p>
