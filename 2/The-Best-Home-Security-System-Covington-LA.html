<p>The length of time does it generally take to flip to your alarm monitoring service? I utilize VOIP today. May move to cellular at some time in the future but sticking with dial-up in the meantime. Naturally, you may wish to consider acquiring a security camera or two to accompany your system, but choosing the five-piece Ring Alarm set plus a Video Doorbell 2 (around $400 total) is a bit more pricey than Frontpoint's most basic bundle for $320 (or $255 with the 20% advertising deal), which does not consist of a camera.</p>
