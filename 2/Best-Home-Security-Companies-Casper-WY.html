While improvements in the last few years have actually made the innovation more popular and robust (some systems today have their own unique wireless innovation, which can't be hindered by other signals), concerns continue over vulnerabilities that do not affect hardwired systems.</p>
<p>The Google Nest Web Cam IQ Outdoor is the most technically innovative outdoor camera we've checked. It has a close-up tracking function, which immediately focuses on motion and then follows it around the field of view. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensor, HDR (high vibrant variety), and 12 x digital zoom.
