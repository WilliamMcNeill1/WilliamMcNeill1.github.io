<p>Home security systems and modern-day clever home abilities and compatibilities permit you to use their sensing units and cameras straight from your phone. Look for a model that provides a high resolution (1080p), a large angle lens (140 to 180 degrees), a night vision variety up to 25 feet, and economical cloud storage for recorded video. In some cases it's useful to be able to see what happened right before or after a visitor approaches your door.

After we used the Anker EufyCam for nearly six months, we're shocked to report that it is on track to provide on its pledge of approximately one year of battery life. What we do not love is that it leaves spaces in between recordings, which ranged anywhere from 4 to 34 seconds, depending upon the settings. We have actually noticed some improvements since the camera's launch, and will continue to test and upgrade this evaluation, as required.</p>
