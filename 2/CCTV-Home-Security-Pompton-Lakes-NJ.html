<p>Six basic CCTV security camera technologies exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. ADT likewise has more industry experience and more monitoring centers than SimpliSafe.

<p>Frame rate: This is another crucial aspect of a camera-- the higher the frame rate, the smoother the video. Video is just a series of still images sewn together to create a motion picture. The lower the frame rate, the less regularly a still is taken; this leads to choppier video. You'll wish to think about the frame rate of the camera you buy before choosing. For referral, "real time" is generally measured as 30 frames per second.
