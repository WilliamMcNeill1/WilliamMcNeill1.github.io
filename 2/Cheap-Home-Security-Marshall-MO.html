<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks totally typical because the doorway and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of catching video of everyone entering the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Sadly, when customers realize that the low-cost consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's usually far too late since the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
