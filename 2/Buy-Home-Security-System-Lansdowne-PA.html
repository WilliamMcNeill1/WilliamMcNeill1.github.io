Storage capacity: For video recorders, the very first question you have to ask yourself is how much storage you will require. The answer depends upon a couple of factors: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived video footage you mean to save and how long you plan to keep recorded video.

This is also called the reasonable choice theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is also grounded in situational criminal offense avoidance method, which argues that chances to upset can be reduced by changing a range of systems such as increasing the danger of an offender being captured, increasing the effort to commit the criminal offense, reducing rewards from criminal offense commission, and lowering provocations that give rise to criminal opportunities (La Vigne et al. 2011).
