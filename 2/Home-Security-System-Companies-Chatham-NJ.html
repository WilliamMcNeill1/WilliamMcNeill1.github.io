Produce a database of loved ones and get alerts telling you "Molly" or "Andrew" is at the door.</p>
<p>Cameras with built in wifi that talk to an existing network needs to be within 300 feet for ideal performance. With cameras that communicate with wifi NVR's positioning of the camera close to the NVR is definitely something to be considered. For instance if the only thing blocking the NVR from a camera is a window there would not be much of a problem however if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is mounted on second story wall, this would cause a disturbance in the signal. A wireless bridge is a terrific alternative for long range situations where trees and poles are not present.</p>

<p>While it strikes the resolution, we suspect there's a little interpolation on its 4K video footage given that the Arlo Ultra's recordings can tend to be a little smeary when zoomed right in, but this is still by far the sharpest security camera we've seen in action, wireless or otherwise.
