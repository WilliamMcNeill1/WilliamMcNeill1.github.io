<p>Dependability is a highly subjective when it comes to innovation matter, depending upon which features and benefits a private favors. Wireless security systems are more integratable and agile, however low signal strength and bad connection are still common problems. Hardwired systems need very little maintenance, and except a general power blackout, are harder to interfere with.
