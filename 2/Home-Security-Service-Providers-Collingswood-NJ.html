<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important feature. Also great metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Should be a better way to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
