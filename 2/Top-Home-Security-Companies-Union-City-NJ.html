The technology slowly progressed into the highly advanced yet cost effective systems readily available today. The first uses of CCTV cameras required monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the ways to record video and view it later. Although video surveillance was monitored out of requirement in the early days, nowadays it is a deliberate practice to improve the result of security systems.</p>
<p>In its truest type, a CCTV camera is an analog video camera that sends signals by means of coax cable to a single main location for monitoring, recording, and video analysis.

<p>Nurse calling systems typically consist of emergency buttons or pull strings within the patient's toilet. If a client is having trouble, he can press the button or pull the string and it will send out an alert to the nurse station. This is a basic switch that is typically open or generally closed. The majority of your commercial security cameras consist of dry contact input ports to integrate alarms and signals, sensors, gain access to control, and so on.
