It has a close-up tracking function, which automatically focuses on motion and after that follows it around the field of view.

<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do nowadays - you will more than likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can move the large amount of data needed by digital video and high resolutions at extremely fast speeds, and frequently over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that typically powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are dependable, but not suitable with IP cameras. Oftentimes, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, removing the need for additional wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch when the security cameras are not connected to an NVR. Wireless security cameras may need less wiring in the walls but will still need cable televisions to power the security camera independently, generally by means of 110VAC power.</p>
