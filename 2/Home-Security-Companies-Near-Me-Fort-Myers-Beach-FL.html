We considered both the TP-Link Kasa Area (KC100) and the Kasa Web Cam (KC120) for one of our top spots. Nevertheless, neither model has geofencing, and the KC120 left spaces of approximately 25 seconds in between recordings. The Area can tape-record up to 3 minutes without gaps in between clips, but entries were often missing, despite appearing in the app's activity timeline. With basic wise home gadgets like automated door locks, you can stay in bed and examine that you locked your doors. And a video doorbell lets you keep an eye out for prospective plan thieves or speak with visitors who drop in.</p>
