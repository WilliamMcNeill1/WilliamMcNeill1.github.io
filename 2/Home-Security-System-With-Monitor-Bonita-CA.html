<p>So, while alarm might have some benefit for alarm owners as part of a general security bundle, the concern remains whether non-alarm owners in the neighborhood need to take on a share of the cost. If alarm usage resulted in improved public safety-- that is, alarms caused much greater burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, fewer burglaries throughout an entire jurisdiction-- its public value would be more apparent. Nevertheless, the truth that alarm calls are extremely incorrect and do not contribute considerably to cops ability to nab intruders makes the underwriting of alarm reaction by police and whole neighborhoods (all taxpayers fund authorities response to alarmed homes) a ineffective and costly method to burglary decrease across an entire jurisdiction.</p>
