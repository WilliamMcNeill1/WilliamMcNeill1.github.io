Wireless security systems are more agile and integratable, but low signal strength and poor connectivity are still typical problems. Hardwired systems require very little maintenance, and except a general power blackout, are harder to disrupt. Despite a basic enhancement in wireless technology, there seem less methods for hardwired systems to be interfered with and disarmed.</p>
