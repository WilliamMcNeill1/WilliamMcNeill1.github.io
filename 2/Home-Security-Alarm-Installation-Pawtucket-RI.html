Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Must be a much better way to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly recommend.</p>
