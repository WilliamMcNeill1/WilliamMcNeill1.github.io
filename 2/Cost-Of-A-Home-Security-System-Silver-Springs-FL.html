<p>Cameras with built in wifi that speak with an existing network must be within 300 feet for optimal efficiency. With cameras that communicate with wifi NVR's positioning of the camera near to the NVR is certainly something to be taken into consideration. For instance if the only thing obstructing the NVR from a camera is a window there wouldn't be much of an issue however if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is mounted on 2nd story wall, this would cause a disruption in the signal.

Search for a camera that supports up-to-date wireless security procedures, such as WPA2, and make certain it secures internet transmission of your user name, your password, and the live feeds. Never ever install a security camera (or a router or any other gadget on your home network) without altering its default user ID and password.</p>
