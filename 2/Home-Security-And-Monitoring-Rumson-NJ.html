Tech is expected to make our lives easier and Hive's environment lives up to that. It's all the function without any disappointment.</p>

This implies the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the very same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread that image throughout a far bigger area and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>
