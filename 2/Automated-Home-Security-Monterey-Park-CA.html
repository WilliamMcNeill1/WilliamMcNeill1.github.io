It also makes your camera more tamper-proof because it does not have wires that can be cut.

These cameras hold true 1080p and work perfectly right out of package. They are well aligned and focused. The clearness is truly terrific. Night vision is true 1080p at around 40ft, however still can see pretty good after that. These cameras are what you require to buy, and do not go cheap.</p>
