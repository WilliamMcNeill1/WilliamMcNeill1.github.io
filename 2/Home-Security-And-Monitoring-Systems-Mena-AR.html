<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus theft, scams, and vandalism. Tip: Typically keyholders are not offered and the alarm does not reset.

<p>To determine reaction times for the monitoring company, we activated each system a minimum of 5 times, utilizing contact and motion sensing units. However, remember that the monitoring company's response time has definitely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will react to the alarm-- if they react at all. In Los Angeles, for example, all alarm calls need to be confirmed, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City requires confirmation from a personal security personnel. Several cities also require a license to even own and operate a home security system. Rules such as these are created to limit the time and resources that cops and fire departments waste on false alarms. Many municipalities will fine you for too many incorrect alarms.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not great-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have terrible night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far a lot of motion activates.</p>
