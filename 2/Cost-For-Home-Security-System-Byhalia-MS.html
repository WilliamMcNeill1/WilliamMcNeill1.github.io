You could invest a similar quantity for the very best home security system, but they do not monitor your cameras as proactively as Deep Guard. However, they're the best home security cameras if you're searching for active monitoring. One important exception: ADT has a landline monitoring plan that's $36.99 each month, which might be a budget friendly alternative for customers in rural areas.
