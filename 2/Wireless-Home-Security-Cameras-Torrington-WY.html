<p>A wired security system was the very first type of security system that was created for homeowners. It must be installed by a professional alarm installation team and, when installed, is tough to move from one place to another. Wired systems are more common for large properties and are typically more expensive than a wireless home security system. They can include outdoor cameras and an indoor camera much like the wireless system. In order to install the hardwired security system, the team will need to remodel the existing wires in your home.
