<p>Frontpoint's outdoor cameras are the most budget friendly in regards to both equipment cost and regular monthly monitoring costs. They utilize infrared night vision, have adjustable settings, and live stream to the Frontpoint app. To get the most out of the camera, location it where it's most noticeable. Its wireless installation offers you a lot of versatility. If the camera is battery powered you can place it practically anywhere without any wires, getting rid of and charging the battery when it runs low, which is typically triggered through its app. Clearly the advantage is that these can be put anywhere extremely quickly, but the downside is that if it's easy for you to remove the camera to change the battery, it'll probably be easy for burglars to remove it too.</p>
