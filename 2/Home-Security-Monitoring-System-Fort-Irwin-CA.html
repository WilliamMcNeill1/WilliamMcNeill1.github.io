<p>Various types of CCTV cameras. Surveillance camera installed on the walls of Rosenbad, one of the Swedish's federal government buildings in main Stockholm, which houses the Prime Minister's office.

<p>The NVR eliminates these problems, since it is instead connected straight to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the very same network, typically by way of a PoE switch, are then able to send video footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, merely since they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transmit video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity constraints so long as a camera is connected to the very same network as the NVR. The largest drawback to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR. So you'll need to understand whether your cameras will be compatible with a provided video recorder prior to purchasing.</p>
