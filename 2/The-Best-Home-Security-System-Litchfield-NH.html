<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection item category is a collection of news, product listings and other resources for security professionals investigating Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection items. We thought about both the TP-Link Kasa Area (KC100) and the Kasa Web Cam (KC120) for one of our top spots. Nevertheless, neither model has geofencing, and the KC120 left spaces of approximately 25 seconds in between recordings.
