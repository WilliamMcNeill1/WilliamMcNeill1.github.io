<p>With state-of-the-art alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. For instance, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system.

<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential feature. Likewise good metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Should be a better method to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly suggest.</p>
