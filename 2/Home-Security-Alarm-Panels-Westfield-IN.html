<p>Network cameras can be used for really cheap surveillance solutions (needing one network camera, some Ethernet cabling, and one PC), or to change whole CCTV setups (cameras end up being network cameras, tape recorders become DVRs, and CCTV monitors become computer systems with TFT screens and specialised software application.
