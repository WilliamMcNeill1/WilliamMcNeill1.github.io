<p>I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential function. Also nice metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Must be a much better way to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
