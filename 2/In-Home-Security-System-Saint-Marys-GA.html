Look for a design that uses a high resolution (1080p), a broad angle lens (140 to 180 degrees), a night vision variety as much as 25 feet, and affordable cloud storage for tape-recorded video.

In regards to cost, Brinks is somewhere in the mid-range: not the most affordable, but not the most costly, either. Totally wire-free cameras also remove the risk of somebody cutting the cable to stop the feed.</p>
<p>The Hive View delivers terrific 1080p images day and night, but the motion activation set off too easily, even when on the most affordable sensitivity setting. Given that this camera has no native geofencing functions, you need to by hand stop notices (and recording, because it does that even when notifications are off). We also experienced above-average connection problems, with two Hive test systems detaching 8 times over two months. Scout is very easy to use, particularly if you're a fan of mobile devices. The Scout mobile app works for iOS, Android, and web-based browsers, and it enables you to control practically every element of the security system from another location, and it's extremely customizable.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not fantastic but good-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far too many motion sets off.</p>
