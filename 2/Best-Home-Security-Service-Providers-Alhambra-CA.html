<p>Developing a safe and secure  environment for a commercial or house is the obligation of the whole neighborhood. Storage capacity: For video recorders, the very first concern you have to ask yourself is just how much storage you will require. The response depends upon a couple of aspects: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived footage you plan to save and the length of time you prepare to keep taped video footage. If there are numerous cameras shooting in a higher resolution, the video footage is going to eat up storage area quickly.

<p>Unlike many other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Instead, you can filter event alerts only by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is offered only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more signals, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When utilized in high-traffic locations, the subscription is more useful. Otherwise, the Smart Area feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent informs every time you walk by.
