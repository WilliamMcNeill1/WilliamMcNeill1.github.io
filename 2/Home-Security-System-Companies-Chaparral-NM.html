<p>At night, though it does not have the full IR LED array of some competitors, the Arlo captures enough light to see a good range, and there's an adjustable spotlight readily available if you're positioning it outdoors - which nicely brings us to the fantastic motion detection. Not just is the Arlo fast to pick out moving products, it's brainy enough to make a good stab at working out precisely what it's looking at. Just a couple decades ago, the home security market was dominated by a few huge names providing costly, stiff plans with little flexibility and unfriendly, long-lasting contracts. Systems were restricted to a couple wired motion sensing units linked to a keypad control board and run through a landline. Nowadays, this has actually all altered.</p>

<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and sometimes, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or even in a garage without climate control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clearness succumbing to the harsh environment.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not fantastic however good-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have dreadful night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far a lot of motion triggers.</p>
