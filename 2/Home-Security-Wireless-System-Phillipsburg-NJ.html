<p>Unlike a lot of other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Instead, you can filter event notices just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is available only with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more alerts, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When utilized in high-traffic areas, the membership is more useful. Otherwise, the Smart Area feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid informs every time you walk by. Unusually, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing uses to each user separately, so if everyone in your family has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>
