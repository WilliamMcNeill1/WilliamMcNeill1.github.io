For instance if the only thing obstructing the NVR from a camera is a window there wouldn't be much of an issue but if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is mounted on second story wall, this would cause a disruption in the signal.

Therefore, it only makes sense that a security system that engages as many senses as possible is more efficient.

<p>Unlike a lot of other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Rather, you can filter event notices just by high activity, days, or person (the latter is offered just with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more signals, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When utilized in high-traffic areas, the membership is more useful. Otherwise, the Smart Location feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent alerts whenever you walk by.
