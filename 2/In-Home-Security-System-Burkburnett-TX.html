The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Likewise nice metal building and construction.

Should be a much better method to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker.
