<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Likewise nice metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Should be a much better method to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker.
