<p>Developing a safe and secure  environment for a commercial or home is the responsibility of the whole community. Storage capacity: For video recorders, the first question you need to ask yourself is how much storage you will require. The response hinges on a couple of elements: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived video you intend to keep and for how long you prepare to keep documented video. The footage is going to consume up storage space quickly if there are lots of cameras shooting in a higher resolution.

Hi Rebeca, thanks for this blog. I am so happy that you have actually discussed about smart home combination Simply last week I was provided lot of cameras to install by a home owner, sadly the owner did not buy cameras compatible with his home automation systems.
