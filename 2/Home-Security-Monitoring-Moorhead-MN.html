<p>The Canary is one of the largest cameras we checked, and it offers two-way interaction with its paid Canary Subscription. The price of the Canary View makes the size a bit more tasty, however the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't consistent during our testing. The Netatmo Welcome doesn't have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it constantly asked us to recognize already-identified faces.

<p>Some wireless home security systems provide a video recording storage alternative and others don't.

The systems with video storage usually consist of either a local storage or cloud storage alternative. A local storage option saves a pre-determined variety of video clips on the device itself.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially remarkable by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we would not recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home functions. But if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
