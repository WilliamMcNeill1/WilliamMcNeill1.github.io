<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial function. Likewise great metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Must be a much better method to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly recommend.</p>
