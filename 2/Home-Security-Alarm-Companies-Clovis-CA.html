In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that combines the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely regular since the entrance and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of catching video of everyone going into the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras.
