<p>Get best-in-class security, plus clever home automation the entire family will love. ADT is a household name, so we frequently experiment with their systems to ensure they're still up-to-task. In our most current round of testing, we recognized that ADT is the most popular provider for a reason.

PoE switches are likewise usually considered a more secure way to transfer data.</p>
<p>In August 2019, the LockPickingLawyer YouTube channel published a video showing how to hack into a SimpliSafe system using a $2 remote. When it detected any type of disturbance, SimpliSafe responded with a statement saying the system would notify users. The company likewise questioned the video, declaring that there would need to be an ideal storm of situations for someone to effectively hack the system. Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests using 2 different 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensors located 6 to 26 feet away from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were unable to reproduce the issue. Although our testing shouldn't be taken as conclusive, we believe this issue is unlikely to be a real-world problem for SimpliSafe consumers who own the current system.</p>
