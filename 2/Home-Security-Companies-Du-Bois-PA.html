We like that the system consists of a wifi security camera and only notifies you when motion is created by something with the exact same heat pattern as a human (ensuring there's no false notifies). However, you do need to sign up for the external monitoring service (from â‚¤ 12.99 monthly) to be able to see recording from the wifi security camera and get notifies on your phone if the sensing units have been activated. There's no external alarm either. Other packages are readily available that have essential fobs and additional sensing units, too.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not great but good-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only by means of a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far too many motion triggers.</p>
