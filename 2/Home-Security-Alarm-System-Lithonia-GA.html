The specific placement near the entrance and exit is key as well.

<h3>CCTV Surveillance Camera Lithonia GA 30058</h3>
<p>Blink cameras are compact, consist of complimentary storage, and utilize two AA batteries that can last up to 2 years. However, to conserve that battery power, recordings max out at simply 10 seconds, with the system leaving a gap of in between 12 seconds and 35 seconds from one clip to the next. Also, the Blink does not offer you geofencing or two-way communication, and its 720p image was a bit fuzzy in darker locations.
