<p>Exits and Entrances - Security cameras positioned at the entrances and exits to your business will track not only who enters your business, but for how long they stay. The specific placement near the entrance and exit is key as well.

However, to conserve that battery power, recordings max out at simply 10 seconds, with the system leaving a gap of in between 12 seconds and 35 seconds from one clip to the next. Also, the Blink does not offer you geofencing or two-way communication, and its 720p image was a bit fuzzy in darker locations.
