So, make sure you know what you're getting into prior to you sign the dotted line.</p>
<p>Canary has actually got over some initial software application issues to offer an extremely good security camera option: especially that crisp 1080p video, with a 147-degree field of view, night vision and motion informs (plus clear audio).
