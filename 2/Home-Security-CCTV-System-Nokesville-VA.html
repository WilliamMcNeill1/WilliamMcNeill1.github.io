<p>Though the Arlo Ultra (see listed below) technically has all the very same smarts and more detailed 4K resolution, the Arlo Pro 3 still won our T3 Awards 2020 award for Best Smart Security , due to the fact that its image quality is still excellent, and it's slightly better worth - though its price is still its achilles' heel. Still, what you get for the money is all the normal Arlo qualities in terms of the solid construct quality, excellent camera video footage, lots of smart functions and a polished app.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not terrific however good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the rate of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have terrible night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion activates.</p>
