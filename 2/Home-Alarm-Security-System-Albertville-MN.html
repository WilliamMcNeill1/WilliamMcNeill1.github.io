<p>3 big advantages of wireless security systems for renters are their impermanence, expandability and mobility. Renters, unlike homeowners, typically prevent making long-term modifications to their homes. Hardwired security systems therefore aren't useful; they involve drilling into walls and setting up irreversible electrical circuits. In contrast, wireless security utilizes equipment that's either freestanding or affixed to walls and entranceways with removable adhesive. Wireless control panels, sensing units and other parts can easily be established at different residential or commercial properties in the future, and wireless systems are easily expanded with new components too. Wireless security strategies likewise permit remote control of the system and general home automation.

The control unit usually has a separate channel or zone for burglar and fire sensing units, and better systems have a different zone for every various sensor, as well as internal trouble signs (mains power loss, low battery, broken wire, and so on).</p>
