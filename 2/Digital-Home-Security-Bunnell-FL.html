<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial function. Also nice metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Must be a better method to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely advise.</p>
