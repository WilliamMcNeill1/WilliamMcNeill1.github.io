<p>The loudest of the clever alarm systems we evaluated, the Somfy Home Alarm Video does a good task at warning anybody in your home and those nearby that there's a problem. Throughout screening, the siren fasted to sound when any of the sensing units were activated and we enjoy that the level of sensitivity of the motion sensing unit can be adjusted to account for pets, too. The alarm system is just one of two we evaluated that includes an external siren, and we're satisfied that it also comes with a dummy siren that can be connected to another external wall, even more dissuading anyone from attempting to break in to your home. We checked Somfy's more costly system, which included a wifi security camera, however more affordable kits are also offered.
