<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, normally referred to as shock sensors, are different because they are installed on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces particular shock frequencies which take a trip through the glass and often through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling. Normally, the most extreme frequencies generated are in between 3 and 5 kHz, depending upon the type of glass and the existence of a plastic interlayer. Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn create an alarm condition.</p>
