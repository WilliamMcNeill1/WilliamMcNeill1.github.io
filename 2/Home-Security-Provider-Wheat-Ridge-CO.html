<p>Closed circuit television (CCTV) surveillance is a kind of situational criminal offense avoidance developed to prevent both individual and property crime and can be utilized in place of, or in addition to, police. Public surveillance cameras monitor, record, and send pictures of a particular location of interest and are either monitored from another location by security workers or preprogramed to scan the specified location (La Vigne et al. 2011). It is believed that the increased surveillance offered by CCTV will decrease criminal activity and boost arrest, without displacing crime to other neighboring locations where CCTV is not in use (Ratcliffe 2009).</p>

<p>Three huge benefits of wireless security systems for renters are their impermanence, expandability and mobility. Occupants, unlike homeowners, typically prevent making permanent modifications to their homes. Hardwired security systems therefore aren't practical; they include drilling into walls and installing long-term electrical circuits. On the other hand, wireless security uses equipment that's either freestanding or affixed to walls and entryways with removable adhesive. Wireless control panels, sensors and other parts can easily be set up at different residential or commercial properties in the future, and wireless systems are quickly expanded with new components too. Wireless security plans also permit remote control of the system and general home automation. Inspect out our list of top systems with home automation functions if home automation is your main appeal.</p>
