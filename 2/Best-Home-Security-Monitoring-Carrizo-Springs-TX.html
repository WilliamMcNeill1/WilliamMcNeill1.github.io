<p>The 2nd primary distinction is the prices. Wired systems can be notoriously costly. Every element of the system will cost you money. So, at the end, who's robbing who? With prices so high, it often isn't worth it for house owners to have a wired security system unless their spending plan is large enough to fit the system conveniently.
