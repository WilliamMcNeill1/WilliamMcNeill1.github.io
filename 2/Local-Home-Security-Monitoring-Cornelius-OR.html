<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential feature. Also great metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Should be a much better way to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>
