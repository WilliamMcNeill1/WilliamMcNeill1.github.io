<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential feature. Also great metal construction.

Should be a much better way to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker.
