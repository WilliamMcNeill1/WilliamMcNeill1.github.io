<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential feature. Likewise nice metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Must be a better way to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely recommend.</p>
