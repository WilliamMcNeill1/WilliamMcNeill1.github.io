A more advanced kind of CCTV, making use of digital video recorders (DVRs), supplies recording for perhaps many years, with a variety of quality and performance choices and additional features (such as motion detection and email signals). More recently, decentralized IP cameras, maybe equipped with megapixel sensing units, support recording directly to network-attached storage devices, or internal flash for entirely stand-alone operation.</p>
<p>IP cameras are much greater resolution, enabling audio and video surveillance to be sent over a network, with IP addresses designated to each camera.

In Los Angeles, for example, all alarm calls need to be validated, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City requires verification from a personal security personnel. A number of cities likewise need an authorization to even own and run a home security system. Rules such as these are developed to restrict the time and resources that cops and fire departments waste on incorrect alarms. Lots of towns will fine you for a lot of false alarms.</p>
