<p>Establishing a secure and safe environment for a commercial or home is the duty of the whole community. Storage capability: For video recorders, the first question you need to ask yourself is how much storage you will require. The answer hinges on a couple of aspects: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived video footage you mean to keep and the length of time you prepare to keep documented video footage. If there are lots of cameras shooting in a greater resolution, the video footage is going to eat up storage area rapidly. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the earliest footage as soon as you reach the system's capacity, but if you're not mindful, the system may overwrite archived video footage that you still require.</p>
