<p>Twenty-five years ago, general and business interactions were primarily simultaneous. To accomplish nearly anything, someone live" needed to be on the other side of the table or telephone line, particularly when handling nationwide and worldwide business. The same holds true for security and video surveillance.

Whatever is synchronized and everything occurs in real time.</p>
<p>Our alarm systems may be equipped in the Away" or Stay" mode. When the alarm system are activated, each monitored zone has the ability to acknowledge a violation. Once a zone has been broken, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and transfers the message through a telephone line.

Going into the code on the alarm system's keypad and switching off the system will end this process with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
