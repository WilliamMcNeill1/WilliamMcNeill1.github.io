Analog cameras, on the other hand, require a switch to run the signal from the camera in addition to a different source of power, meaning a more complicated setup and more wires.

<p>When it comes to how to use one, they work the same as the majority of other security cameras and hook into your existing doorbell setup.

We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have awful night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss far a lot of motion triggers.</p>
